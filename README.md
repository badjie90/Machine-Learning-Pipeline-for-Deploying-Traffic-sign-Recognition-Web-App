# Machine-Learning-Pipeline-for-Deploying-Traffic-sign-Recognition-Web-App


This repository contains a comprehensive and sophisticated end-to-end machine learning pipeline specifically designed for the classification of the German traffic sign recognition benchmark image. Through a rigorous and thorough development process, I have created a highly efficient and accurate tool that is capable of delivering exceptional results in a variety of different scenarios. Furthermore, in order to make this pipeline more accessible and user-friendly, I have also developed a state-of-the-art web application using the Flask framework. This application provides users with an intuitive and streamlined interface, enabling them to quickly and easily classify traffic sign images with a high degree of precision. Additionally, we have also included a link to the dataset used in the development of this pipeline, which can be found within the repository.
